=========
Please modify existing campaign.html per PSD (GM-CreateCampaign01.psd). 
And send the result back to me via email.
You only need to get the progress bar looks the same as PSD, no need to worry about other parts.

You should create a separated file for css and javascripts you implemented.
If you know SCSS you should use scss, otherwise, you can just use css.
